Machine learning is cool! It's cool because it has opened up this new space where we can find answers to questions humans find difficult to answer (also how to survive from 1,000,000 obstacles in flappy bird game is a hard question to answer).

It's cool because its something new the tech geeks have a chance to explore. A few years and it'll probably not be so COOL then.

Ok, now we ready to code it.

Cause we are fouce on the Machine Learning, I will provide the flappy bird javascript template from my other workshop. It' time for _Magic Learning_... I mean.. Machine Learning
